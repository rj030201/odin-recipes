        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 jalapeno, minced</li>
        <li>one 1-inch knob of ginger, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemongrass</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>one 14-ounce can unsweetened coconut cream</li>

        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the chicken: Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the chicken thighs, sprinkle with spices, and cook for 8-10 minutes until cooked through. Remove from pan. Once cooled, shred / pull into small bite-sized pieces. </li>
        <li>Make the lemongrass sauce: Add the garlic, jalapeño, and ginger to the chicken pan (you don’t have to wipe it out – save all those good flavors). Sauté until fragrant. Add the lemongrass and brown sugar; stir to combine. Add coconut cream and bring to a low, gentle simmer. Season with lime zest, lime juice, and salt. </li>
